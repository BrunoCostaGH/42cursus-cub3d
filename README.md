# 42cursus-cub3d ([Subject](/.github/en.subject.pdf))

## Description
This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90's game, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you'll have to find your way.

## Usage

```unix
  ./cub3D <path_to_cub_file> 
```
